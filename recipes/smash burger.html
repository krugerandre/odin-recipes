<h1>Smash Burger recipe</h1>
 <img src="./Smashed-Burger.jpg">
 <h2>Description</h2>  
 A smash burger is a burger that is made by smashing the ground beef 
 onto the grill or griddle with a spatula. 
 Smashing the burger results in a sear on the outside of the meat, 
 which locks in all of the juices and flavor.
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>1 1/2 lbs ground beef, 80/20, divided into 8 portions (3oz each)</ul>
<ul>Salt, added to taste</ul>
<ul>Black Pepper, added to taste</ul>
<ul>garlic powder, optional, added to taste</ul>
<ul>4 slices medium cheddar cheese</ul>
<ul>1/3 cup mayonnaise</ul>
<ul>1 tsp yellow mustard</ul>
<ul>4 burger buns, we used brioche buns</ul>
<ul>1 large tomato, sliced</ul>
<ul>1/2 red onion, sliced into thin rings </ul>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<li>Increase griddle to medium/high heat.</li>
<li>Place 2-4 burger balls onto hot griddle.</li>
<li>Working quickly, place parchment paper over the meat and firmly smash straight down into a thin patty.</li>
<li>Once patties are smashed, peel back and discard parchment papers and season patties with salt, pepper and garlic powder.</li>
<li>Add 1/2 teaspoon of burger sauce.</li> 
<li>Cook 2 minutes on the first side or until seared and juices start to come to the surface.</li>
<li>Scrape under the burger with spatula facing down at a 45Ëš angle to get under the caramelized part and flip.</li>
<li>Top half of the patties with sliced cheese and cover cheese with the second patty.</li> 
<li>Cook another 1 minute. </li>
<li>Repeat with remaining burgers and transfer them to a platter as they finish cooking.</li>
<li>Place sauce on bottom of bun. Top with 3 pickle slices, shredded lettuce, 2 tomato slices and thin sliced onion.</li>
<li>Add double patty and top with bun.</li>
